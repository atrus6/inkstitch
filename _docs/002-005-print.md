## Accessing the Print Preview

Run `Extensions > Embroidery > Print` to export the design to your browser. You have the possibility to adjust some settings, choose from different templates and send it to your (PDF) printer once you are done.

**Info:** If you use Firefox as your standard browser, make sure, the browser is running before you open the print preview. It is reported that Firefox will not recognize your printers if Ink/Stitch has to perform the initial startup.

## Customization

### Editable Fields and Custom Logo
You will notice many editable fields within the print preview. Click with your mouse on the fields and enter your text. Header field customizations will populate automatically on each page.

Don't forget to pick your own logo by clicking on the Ink/Stitch logo. This will open a file picker, choose your logo and click `Open`.

### Stitch Preview

The design preview also has different options. You can adjust the size either by clicking on `Fit`, `100%` or by `Ctrl + Scroll` to scale seemlessly. Grab your design with the mouse and move it inside the canvas to a different place. It is also possible to apply the transformations to all pages by clicking `Apply to all`.

By default the print preview uses the line drawing mode. Check `Realistic` if you wish a realistic rendering preview. It will take a little while to calculate this view, but it's worth waiting. This setting needs to be activated to each single page where you want to use it.

Everything is done, time to return to Inkscape. It is locked right now. There are three different ways to unlock:

1. Close your browser or the preview page tab.
2. Click `Close` within the Ink/Stitch Print Preview page. This might not work for all browsers.
3. Opening the Print Preview Ink/Stitch created a popup-window with a `Close` button. You could press it now. In this case the browser will remain open. Any changes you perform to the document now, will be lost the next time you open the preview.
